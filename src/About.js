          <p>Finding creative solutions to problems is something I have always enjoyed. As a kid I loved
            tinkering with things that were broken, figuring out how they worked, and fixing them again. When I
            finished high school, I knew exactly what I wanted my career to be. I am finishing up my degree at
            Tulsiramji Gaikwad-Patil College of Engineering & Technology,
            Nagpur
            where I have learned how to apply critical thinking and problem-solving strategies to todayâ€™s
            complex problems. </p>
